# Udacity FEND Project - My Reads (A book tracking app)

I made this project for my Front-End Web Development Nanodegree from Udacity. This website allows the user to keep track of books that have been read, are currently being read, or that he or she would like to read.


## How to run

Instructions to clone and run the project:
1. First, clone or download this project on your machine.
